The Client Key Exchange message is a crucial part of the TLS handshake and facilitates the establishment of a shared secret (the premaster secret) between the client and the server. Here is a breakdown of the key details:

When this message is sent:
Client sends it always: It must immediately follow the client certificate message if one is sent. If no certificate is sent, the Client Key Exchange message must be the first message sent after receiving the ServerHelloDone message from the server.
Purpose of this message:
Premaster secret setup: This message sets the premaster secret, which can either be transmitted as an RSA-encrypted secret or through Diffie-Hellman parameters that allow both the client and server to agree on a common secret.
Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman: If the client uses an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exponent, it sends its Diffie-Hellman public value in this message.
Static Diffie-Hellman: If using static Diffie-Hellman authentication (fixed_dh), the message is sent but must be empty.
Structure of the Client Key Exchange:
The structure of the message depends on the KeyExchangeAlgorithm chosen:
RSA: The message contains an EncryptedPreMasterSecret.
Diffie-Hellman variants (dhe_dss, dhe_rsa, dh_dss, dh_rsa, dh_anon): The message contains the client's Diffie-Hellman public value, referred to as ClientDiffieHellmanPublic.
Example structure of the ClientKeyExchange message:
c
Copy
Edit
struct {
    select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
        case rsa:
            EncryptedPreMasterSecret;
        case dhe_dss:
        case dhe_rsa:
        case dh_dss:
        case dh_rsa:
        case dh_anon:
            ClientDiffieHellmanPublic;
    } exchange_keys;
} ClientKeyExchange;
7.4.7.1 RSA-Encrypted Premaster Secret Message
If RSA is used for key exchange and authentication, the client generates a 48-byte premaster secret, encrypts it using the server's public key (from its certificate), and sends it in the EncryptedPreMasterSecret message.
Structure of this message:
c
Copy
Edit
struct {
    ProtocolVersion client_version;
    opaque random[46];
} PreMasterSecret;

struct {
    public-key-encrypted PreMasterSecret pre_master_secret;
} EncryptedPreMasterSecret;
client_version: The latest version supported by the client, used to detect version rollback attacks.
random: A 46-byte securely-generated random value.
pre_master_secret: The encrypted premaster secret (RSA-encrypted) with the length encoded.
RSA encryption considerations:
Version mismatch handling: If there is a version mismatch between the client_version and the expected version, the server must generate the premaster secret with a randomized value.
PKCS#1 Padding: If the RSA decryption fails or padding is incorrect, the server must treat the message in a way that does not reveal the error to attackers, potentially generating a random premaster secret.
7.4.7.2 Client Diffie-Hellman Public Value
If Diffie-Hellman key exchange is used (and not included in a certificate), the client will send its Diffie-Hellman public value (Yc) in the ClientKeyExchange message.
Structure of the message:
c
Copy
Edit
enum { implicit, explicit } PublicValueEncoding;

struct {
    select (PublicValueEncoding) {
        case implicit: struct { };
        case explicit: opaque dh_Yc<1..2^16-1>;
    } dh_public;
} ClientDiffieHellmanPublic;
Implicit: The Diffie-Hellman public value is included in the client certificate (for fixed_dh authentication), so it does not need to be sent again.
Explicit: The client sends the Diffie-Hellman public value (dh_Yc).
This message is part of the key exchange process and plays a central role in securely establishing a session key for communication between the client and server.
